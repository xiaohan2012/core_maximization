  - active users tend to belong to densifying cores
  - nodes at the fringe are more likely to depart

[Vulnerability assessment in social networks under cascade-based node departures](http://iopscience.iop.org/article/10.1209/0295-5075/110/68006), EPL 2015
  - proposes *disengagement epidemic model*, related to k-core
  - can be used to run some simulation to test different network design algorithms
